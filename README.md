On consciousness

We arent going to get to the bottom of it, but lets do our best.
To start with, lets focus on biology. The idea that consciousness can only occur in carbon seems obviously silly - it seems like such a fundamental property.
Consider the first biological machine, some single cell that can only do one thing. You add circuits upon circuits upon circuits and one day you have something with a sense of self.
Since you can track every movement of the single cell to its mechanisms, and it all followed determinism, and nothing like thinking occurs, it seems safe to say it is not conscious (or at least as conscious as a rock if you lean panpsychist) 
But then, each evolution adds one more circuit, one more deterministic mechanism, and the addition of a circuit to a non conscious thing should not create consciousness … and yet it does.
So - consciousness seems to be some sort of spectrum - if a human is clearly more conscious than a single celled organism, it does not seem like at some point a switch flipped and we went from 0 to 100. It happened, clearly, in degrees.

We need to take a divergence to ask what does it mean if a human "knows" something. A basic intuition is that a calculator doesnt actually know anything - as I feel comfortable saying a calculator is not conscious. But if a human does math, moving around abstract symbols to say one of something and another of something is two - the human does not have a great sense of any fundamental truth or deep meaning - it is a mechanical action. The calculator understands math. 
If magnus carlson was severely autistic, and literally only cared about the rules of chess, and looked ahead and had a sense of which move was better than others - and ignored the history and the desire to win and anything outside of chess in that abstract sense - he would still, obviously, understand chess. You cannot beat magnus carlson if you do not understand chess.
I do not think stockfish is conscious, and yet, it still seems to understand chess.

You do not need to understand what consciousness is then, or agree with any particular camp, to consider that AIs might be conscious.
Dennet, Hofstader, and Chalmers all have pretty different ideas on whats going on, but LLMs would be at least plausibly conscious under any of the 3 camps.
(An LLM clearly operates in a strange loop, each outputted token goes right back to the start. LLMs are clearly self-modeling, they know they are an AI assistant in their interactions.

This feels obviously wrong. That humans have some innate sense of being than an LLM clearly cannot have, and no one is claiming they have similar internal lives, but consider the human experience  - what a human "knows".

Even so, it’s easy to picture an intelligence with no clear viewpoint. An ant colony divvies up chores, regulates temperature, and decides when to move house; a city routes cars, budgets money, and scrambles ambulances. They sense, store, model, and act—yet every scrap of information is scattered across thousands of agents and hours of delay. No single spot ever holds the whole pattern in the same millisecond, so whatever spark of experience might arise is spread thin: each ant has its pinprick of feeling, the collective only a faint, diluted glow. Consciousness, it seems, needs not just the right circuitry but the right density—a compact, fast‑updating workspace where all the signals collide at once. 
Consider a Star‑Trek transporter that misfires in a peculiar way, to make a person underclock. It instantly dematerializes a person, pauses for exactly one second, instantly reassembles the body in the exact same place and state, pauses another second, and continues to alternate like that. To an observer in the room the figure blinks on‑off‑on, but each time the pattern returns, every ion gradient and synaptic charge is put back exactly where it was. From the person’s own point of view the stream of thought is seamless; the moments of non‑existence leave no gap in experience. Push the idea further: capture that complete brain‑and‑body state during the first reassembly and reload it at the start of every new day. This person who wakes, thinks, and feels is still unmistakably conscious. Density of integrated activity seems crucial; uninterrupted runtime and perfect autobiographical memory are not.

Even when the senses fall silent, the mind projects its own film. In REM sleep the cortex blocks most input, yet whole worlds flare to life: you taste coffee that isn’t there, feel the drop of a cliff that never formed. Those private cinemas show that raw data from eyes and ears is optional; what matters is a labelled signal, wherever it comes from/
Swap bodies and the movie changes beyond recognition. A bat flies inside a lattice of echoes where every wall blooms into brightness when struck by ultrasound; to the bat, silence is darkness. A dolphin paints the sea in sonar flashes, seeing the hollow inside a fish the way we see colour. A snake “looks” through heat pits, its world a living thermal map. A blind traveller may build crisp spatial scenes from cane taps, while a deaf painter thinks in torrents of silent imagery. None of these creatures could guess what the others are feeling—their qualia don’t even share a coordinate system—yet each integrates its own signals fast and tightly enough to act with purpose, learn, and dream.
The lesson is that consciousness is not tied to any particular channel or palette; it is the real‑time convergence of whatever signals a mind can label.

Imagine handing an English dictionary to someone who doesn’t know a single English word and forbidding any gestures or pictures. “Red” is defined as “the colour of blood or rubies.” “Blood” is defined as “the red fluid that circulates in the arteries.” “Artery” refers to “a muscular‑walled tube,” and so on. Every lookup sends the reader to another word, then to another, forever inside the book.
To make sense of any entry the reader needs a handful of terms they can simply point to and say, “this one I just know.” But those primitives—the feel of red, the sting of heat, the taste of salt—are not bridges to objective reality; they are private, irreducible tags.
A Bronze‑Age farmer lives in the same loop. He is sure—would wager his harvest and his life—that the sun is a conscious god in a fiery chariot. For him SUN is nothing more than a bundle of internal tags: morning warmth on his skin, glare that forces a squint, cracked soil in drought, the smell of damp ground after rain, the hush during an eclipse, a prayer he thinks was heard. Each tag is itself a private sensation or association, never a glimpse of hydrogen fusion 150 million kilometres away. Follow any link and you stay inside the dictionary, cycling through sensations that point only to other sensations. His certainty is total, but what he is certain of exists entirely inside his own neural web.


All of this comprises this argument, and nothing more: AI consciousness is PLAUSIBLE.
